# Development Workflow

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` - Build production version
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint checks

## Code Quality

- Run linting before committing code
- Fix all TypeScript errors before deployment
- Use consistent formatting (consider adding Prettier)
- Write meaningful commit messages

## Feature Development Process

1. **Planning**: Create or update spec documents in `.kiro/specs/`
2. **Implementation**: Follow the task list from specs
3. **Testing**: Write and run tests for new functionality
4. **Review**: Ensure code follows established patterns
5. **Integration**: Test feature integration with existing code

## Error Handling

- Implement proper error boundaries in React
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

## Performance Monitoring

- Monitor bundle size and loading performance
- Use Next.js built-in analytics when available
- Optimize images and assets
- Implement proper caching strategies

## Security Considerations

- Validate all user inputs
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow Next.js security best practices
- Keep dependencies updated
