# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A reaction time game that tests how quickly users can respond to visual stimuli. The game will present a waiting period followed by a color change, and measure the time between the stimulus and the user's click response. This provides an engaging way to test and improve reaction times while offering opportunities to experiment with different game mechanics and visual effects.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to start a reaction time test, so that I can measure how quickly I respond to visual changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks a "Start" button THEN the system SHALL begin a reaction time test
2. WHEN the test begins THEN the system SHALL display a waiting screen with instructions
3. WHEN the waiting period ends THEN the system SHALL change the visual stimulus (color/text)
4. WHEN the user clicks after the stimulus appears THEN the system SHALL record the reaction time
5. WHEN the user clicks before the stimulus appears THEN the system SHALL indicate a false start

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see my reaction time results, so that I can track my performance and try to improve.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a reaction time test completes THEN the system SHALL display the measured time in milliseconds
2. WHEN multiple tests are completed THEN the system SHALL show the current result and previous attempts
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL provide context (e.g., "Average human reaction time is 200-300ms")
4. WHEN results are shown THEN the system SHALL offer an option to try again

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to have unpredictable timing, so that I cannot anticipate when to click and must rely on genuine reaction speed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a test THEN the system SHALL use a random delay between 2-5 seconds before showing the stimulus
2. WHEN the waiting period is active THEN the system SHALL not provide any visual cues about when the stimulus will appear
3. WHEN multiple tests are run THEN the system SHALL use different random delays for each attempt

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want clear visual feedback during the game, so that I understand what state the game is in and what I should do.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN waiting for the stimulus THEN the system SHALL display a distinct visual state (e.g., red background with "Wait..." text)
2. WHEN the stimulus appears THEN the system SHALL change to a clearly different visual state (e.g., green background with "Click!" text)
3. WHEN showing results THEN the system SHALL display the reaction time prominently with clear formatting
4. WHEN a false start occurs THEN the system SHALL show an error message and allow restart

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to be responsive and work well on different devices, so that I can play it on desktop or mobile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the game on mobile THEN the system SHALL respond to touch events as well as clicks
2. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the system SHALL maintain usable proportions and readability
3. WHEN interacting with the game THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback for all user actions
4. WHEN displaying text and buttons THEN the system SHALL ensure they are large enough for touch interaction
