# Design Document

## Overview

The reaction time game will be implemented as a single-page React component that manages different game states through a state machine pattern. The game will use browser timing APIs for precise measurements and provide a clean, accessible interface that works across devices.

## Architecture

### Component Structure
```
ReactionTimeGame (main game component)
├── GameArea (clickable game surface)
├── Instructions (game rules and current state text)
├── Results (reaction time display and statistics)
└── Controls (start/restart buttons)
```

### State Management
The game will use React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage:
- **Game State**: 'idle' | 'waiting' | 'ready' | 'clicked' | 'false-start'
- **Timing Data**: start time, end time, reaction times array
- **UI State**: current instructions, visual styling

## Components and Interfaces

### Main Game Component
```typescript
interface GameState {
  status: 'idle' | 'waiting' | 'ready' | 'clicked' | 'false-start'
  startTime: number | null
  endTime: number | null
  reactionTimes: number[]
  currentAttempt: number
}

interface ReactionTimeGameProps {
  className?: string
}
```

### Game Area Component
- Large clickable surface that fills most of the screen
- Changes background color based on game state
- Handles click/touch events and prevents default behaviors
- Uses CSS transitions for smooth color changes

### Results Component
- Displays current reaction time prominently
- Shows statistics (best, average, attempt count)
- Provides context about typical human reaction times
- Includes visual indicators for performance (good/average/slow)

### Controls Component
- Start/Restart button with appropriate state-based text
- Reset statistics option
- Responsive button sizing for mobile devices

## Data Models

### Reaction Time Entry
```typescript
interface ReactionTime {
  time: number        // milliseconds
  timestamp: Date     // when the test was taken
  attempt: number     // attempt number in current session
}
```

### Game Statistics
```typescript
interface GameStats {
  totalAttempts: number
  bestTime: number | null
  averageTime: number | null
  recentTimes: number[]  // last 5 attempts
}
```

## Error Handling

### False Start Detection
- Track click events during waiting period
- Clear any pending timers when false start occurs
- Display clear error message and reset to idle state
- Prevent multiple rapid clicks from causing issues

### Timing Edge Cases
- Handle browser tab switching (pause/resume detection)
- Validate reaction times (reject impossibly fast < 50ms or slow > 2000ms times)
- Graceful degradation if high-precision timing is unavailable

### User Experience Errors
- Prevent accidental double-clicks affecting results
- Handle rapid start/stop button clicking
- Ensure game remains responsive during state transitions

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Game state transitions and validation
- Timing calculation accuracy
- Statistics computation (average, best time)
- False start detection logic

### Integration Tests
- Complete game flow from start to results
- Multiple consecutive attempts
- State persistence across game sessions
- Responsive behavior on different screen sizes

### User Experience Tests
- Touch vs click interaction consistency
- Visual feedback timing and clarity
- Accessibility with keyboard navigation
- Performance on slower devices

## Implementation Details

### Timing Precision
- Use `performance.now()` for high-precision timestamps
- Store times as milliseconds with decimal precision
- Account for potential browser throttling in background tabs

### Visual Design
- **Waiting State**: Red/orange background with "Wait for green..." text
- **Ready State**: Green background with "Click now!" text
- **Results State**: Neutral background with prominent time display
- **False Start**: Red background with error message

### Responsive Design
- Minimum touch target size of 44px for mobile
- Scalable text that remains readable on all screen sizes
- Flexible layout that works in portrait and landscape
- Consider safe areas on mobile devices

### Performance Considerations
- Minimize re-renders during timing-critical periods
- Use CSS transforms for smooth visual transitions
- Debounce rapid user interactions
- Clean up timers and event listeners properly

### Accessibility
- Proper ARIA labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support (spacebar to click)
- High contrast color combinations
- Clear focus indicators for interactive elements
